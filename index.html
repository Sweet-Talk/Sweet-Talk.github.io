    <h2>DiY Collective</h2>
    <p>As the transition of the event moves from day to night, you are invited to dance to music provided by the DiY Sound System, a Nottingham-based electronic music collective created in 1989.</p>
    <p>Between free parties and club nights around the East Midlands and beyond, the DiY Collective brought together a number of “tribes” from urban ravers to crusty warriors, to create a cohesive, collective, political front against the prevailing anti-rave legislation that was beginning to come into force at that time.</p>
    <p>In 1992, DiY played a key role in hosting the largest illegal rave ever staged in England, which subsequently led to the Criminal Justice Bill coming into legislation.</p>

The work also uses text taken from <a href="https://www.twitter.com/empathydeck">@empathydeck</a>, Scourti's 'bot with feelings', a Twitter bot commissioned by the Wellcome Collection that generates content from a mix of her diary entries and therapeutic texts.</p>

    <p>Jake Kent has created the brand identity of Sweet Talk. Looking at early DIY club night promotional strategies combined with anarchist aesthetics, Kent explores the regurgitation of culture and its role in the production of Capital, cynicism, apathy and emotion in the neo-liberal age, and the authenticity and effect of the subcultures he finds himself in.</p>

      <h2>'Sweet Talk: The Achatic Rites' is the first chapter in a series of events, exhibitions and artworks, and is a</br> collaboration between <a href="http://www.meaningfulmeaninglessness.info/">Candice Jacobs</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ericascourti.com/">Erica Scourti</a>.</h2>
      <p>'Sweet Talk: The Achatic Rites' was structured to coincide with the new moon of the 1st October 2016.</p>
      <p>Each month we have a new moon (when the Moon and the Sun occupy the same sign of the zodiac). The new moon brings about a time to begin new projects, initiate contracts, make new connections and forge new relationships, partnerships and business transactions.</p>
      <p>Drawing on concepts from shamanism, astrology, rituals, language, rave culture and conversation, 'Sweet Talk: The Achatic Rites' explored a need to develop a new system of collective self-care.</p>
      <p>Linking divinatory systems to the evolution of technology from ancient civilisation to the present moment, the event explored the genuine potential for the personal and social transformation of the group, while drawing out the tensions between the commodification of spiritual traditions and the construction of identity.</p>
        <p>Taking the startup conference trend of the ‘Fireside Chat’ at face value, 'Sweet Talk: The Achatic Rites' planned to host a series of discussions, performances and social spaces for conversation around a campfire, a geodesic dome and pyramids in an outside location in Nottingham. However, due to terrible weather conditions on the day, the event was relocated to <a href="http://www.broadway.org.uk">Broadway</a>'s studio where the talks were recorded.</p>

		<h1>Introduction by Erica Scourti</h1>
		<div>
  <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-1" />

 	<p class="read-more-wrap">By way of introduction I wanted to draw some links between the day's themes, which include technology and ritual as modes of exploring identity, and the connection between personal and collective experience.
	</br>
	</br>
Rituals, when conducted by individuals and collectives, could be seen as ways as affecting and transforming both the identity of the participants and the outcome of cosmic events; like magic, and spells, they are gestures and incantations with agency, that have the power to influence and manipulate the world around them. <span class="read-more-target">Whether the focus be inscrutable, unfriendly gods, unpredictable elements of nature, or ones' romantic affairs, rituals are performative by nature in that they attempt to control and ultimately change the world around them. All kind of apps, software, and new techs similarly promise to change the world, or at least one tiny part of it, and it's no coincidence that words alluding to magic and sorcery turn up all the time in tech, from set up 'wizards' to 'magic wands'. Meanwhile Silicon Valley solutionism casts the fresh-faced men of tech as healers (saviours?!) of the world's social and ecological issues with the magical mantra 'there's an app for that!'
	</br>
	</br>
Through the work of the invited artists, whose research touches on sigil-making, astrology, free parties, and the complexity of living with ambivalence in a fucked up system, this event also explores different forms of agency- political, personal, magical- asking to what extent individual rituals and gestures can have any collective agency beyond personal transformation.</span></p>
